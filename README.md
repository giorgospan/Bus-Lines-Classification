  * **Part 1:** The purpose of this part is to familiarize us with the use of gmplot python library by visualizing 5 different bus lines (i.e: journeyPatternIDs). 
  
  * **Part 2:**
  
  * **Part 3:**  


It utilizes Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) & Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) as similarity measures between bus trajectories.    

KNN-Classifier is also used in part 4 for classification purposes. Note that there is no dataset uploaded yet for the this part.    

Multiprocessing is achieved using Python's multiprocessing module.

*More details will be added soon !!!*
